# /dev/uino
A standard device library for Arduino and other -ino's

It's a mess here right now, but work is going on!
The goal with ths project is to create a clean and well-coded library for all kinds of devices attachable to Arduinos.

Currently the source/roadmap file contain the layout for the library.

# Example code
This is a basic example program where a pushbutton and the on-circutboard led (number 13) are used. When the button is pressed the led light up.  
The button is connected between arduino pin 3 and ground (because then the built-in pullup resistor can be used) and initiated by creating a *Button* object with a *Onboard* pin (onboard the Arduino board) set to use pin number 3. In the loop `button.value()` reads the boolean value if the button is pressed or not.

```cpp
#include <devuino.h>

Button<Onboard> button(Onboard(3), Resistor::PullUp);
Led<Onboard> led(Onboard(13));

void setup()
{
}

void loop()
{
    led.set(button.value());
}
```
