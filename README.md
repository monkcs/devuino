# /dev/uino

A device library for Arduino and other -ino's.

The goal with this project is to create a clean and well-coded library for all kinds of devices attachable to Arduinos. By utilizing modern C++ to create an efficient and high-level abstraction compared to vanilla arduino functions.

It's a mess here right now, but work is going on!  

Help is always wanted! If you want to write a device driver for the library, or just give a suggestion for a specific device, please open a issue.

## Example

Following example demonstrate on a ATmega328 (Arduino Uno), how to program the on-circutboard led (pin 13) to turn on when a push-button is pressed.

Two device objects are created, `Button` and `Light`.
The push-button is connected between pin 3 and ground, and uses the built-in pullup resistor. The light is connected to pin 13.

In the loop the reading of the current state of the button is assigned to the led.

```cpp
#include <devuino.hpp>

void setup()
{
    ATmega328 cpu;

    Button button {cpu.digital.input(3), Resistor::PullUp};
    Light led {cpu.analog.output(13)};

    while (true)
    {
        led = button;
    }
 }

void loop() { }
```

## Installation

To download the library, use the [Arduino IDE Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/devuino/).

Note that the library requires at least C++17, so editing of the ```platform.txt``` file is required. The file, usually located at ```~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/x.x.x/platform.txt``` should be changed on line ```compiler.cpp.flags``` to have the flag ```-std=gnu++17``` instead of the default one.
